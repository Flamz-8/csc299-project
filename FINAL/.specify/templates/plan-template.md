# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Validate this feature against constitution principles (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

**I. Code Quality First**:
- [ ] Linting/formatting tools configured for this feature's tech stack
- [ ] Code complexity limits defined (cyclomatic complexity ≤10)
- [ ] Public API documentation requirements understood
- [ ] Type safety approach determined (strict typing where applicable)

**II. Testing Standards**:
- [ ] Test-first workflow planned (tests before implementation)
- [ ] Test categories identified: Unit, Integration, Contract, Edge Cases
- [ ] Coverage targets defined (≥80% line coverage, 100% for critical paths)
- [ ] Test independence verified (no shared state between tests)

**III. User Experience Consistency**:
- [ ] Response time budgets defined (100ms acknowledge, 1s p95 complete)
- [ ] Error message standards established (human-readable, actionable, consistent)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements identified (WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
- [ ] Design system components identified (if UI feature)
- [ ] Loading states and offline behavior planned

**IV. Performance Requirements**:
- [ ] Performance budgets defined (latency p50/p95/p99, memory, CPU, payload sizes)
- [ ] Performance testing approach planned (load tests, stress tests, profiling)
- [ ] Monitoring strategy defined (metrics, alerts, thresholds)
- [ ] Database performance considerations (query plans, indexes, N+1 prevention)

**Violations Requiring Justification**: (if any, document in Complexity Tracking below)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
